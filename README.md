## Hello, my name is TJ.

I am a lifelong learner with a never ending curiosity for how things work, which is one of the main reasons I've always found technology so intriguing. That curiosity has driven me to explore everything from networking, 3d printing and modeling, content creation, videography/photography and more. I’m currently working toward my Google Cybersecurity Certificate to further expand my technical foundation and strengthen my skills in securing modern systems and networks. My goal is to continue learning, experimenting, and growing in the IT field while building meaningful and enjoyable projects along the way. Below is some more in depth information about me
